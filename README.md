Documentation of this project:

I have created a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that can convert any currency to the required currency. The website also changes the flag automatically when you select the "from" and "to" currencies using the Flags API: https://flagsapi.com/${currCountry}/flat/64.png.

For extracting the currency exchange rates, I used the Currency API: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fawazahmed0/currency-api@latest/v1/currencies/${baseCurrency}.

I thoroughly enjoyed developing this website and learned a lot from this project. It taught me how to use APIs, fetch data from them, handle promises using both .then() and async/await, and manage JSON data. Although I initially faced some issues while fetching the API, my persistence paid off, and I successfully completed the project.
